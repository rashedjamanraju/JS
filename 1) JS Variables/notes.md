Naming Conventions

Naming Rules
    Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    Names must begin with a letter.
    Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
    Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
    Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
